# Calibration workflow (chain into AMC)

Parent: [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md). Load this reference **only when** the user picked `videos` or `rtsp` in Q1 AND the calibration check in Q2 found `calibration.json` + `camInfo/` missing or incomplete.

**Skip when:** Q1 = `sample` (calibration ships with the repo) or the user has supplied a calibration path themselves — go straight to [`configure-cameras.md`](configure-cameras.md) → [`deploy-rtvi-cv-3d-stack.md`](deploy-rtvi-cv-3d-stack.md).

This reference drives AMC end-to-end via its REST API — the user does **not** open the AMC UI. Hand-back to SKILL.md happens once calibration files are landed at the MV3DT mount path.

## Where calibration must end up

For perception and BEV fusion to read them, calibration files must live at:

```
${VSS_APPS_DIR}/industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-mv3dt-app/calibration/sample-data/${SAMPLE_VIDEO_DATASET}/
├── calibration.json                        # consumed by vss-behavior-analytics-mv3dt (warehouse-mv3dt-app.yml:25)
├── camInfo/cam_*.yaml                      # consumed by vss-rtvi-cv-mv3dt (warehouse-mv3dt-app.yml:283)
└── images/                                 # optional reference frames, matches sample layout
```

The user's Q3 slug becomes the `${SAMPLE_VIDEO_DATASET}` directory name.

## Step 1 — Hand off to the AMC skill for setup

**Do not reinvent AMC setup here.** Walk the full deploy flow in [`../../vss-generate-video-calibration/references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md`](../../vss-generate-video-calibration/references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md) end-to-end. For MV3DT chaining, follow Path B (standalone `COMPOSE_PROFILES=auto-calib`). The AMC skill owns the canonical procedure and will stay in sync with the AMC microservice as it evolves.

The MV3DT chain has two skill-specific requirements on top of the AMC skill's defaults:

### 1a. Stage VGGT before the calibration run (recommended for MV3DT)

The AMC skill marks VGGT as **optional Step 2** ("Skip unless the user explicitly asks for VGGT-refined output"). For the MV3DT use case, **stage it anyway** — the MV3DT export endpoint (`GET /v1/result/<id>/mv3dt_result?result_type=vggt`) returns VGGT-refined calibration which yields better BEV Fusion accuracy than the bare AMC output. The wall-clock cost is one-time (model download ~4.7 GB + a separate VGGT calibration pass after the main calibration completes).

Follow `deploy-auto-calibration-service.md` **Step 2** verbatim — HuggingFace license-accept, `HF_TOKEN`, `hf download facebook/VGGT-1B-Commercial`, place at `${VSS_DATA_DIR}/auto-calib/vggt/vggt_1B_commercial.pt`, `chmod a+r`. Skip only if the user explicitly opts out of VGGT (small accuracy hit, but still works).

### 1b. VIOS preflight (rtsp mode only)

If Q1 was `rtsp`, walk `deploy-auto-calibration-service.md` **Step 2b** — VIOS needs to be reachable at `${VST_INTERNAL_URL}` so AMC can ingest live streams. For `videos` mode, VIOS is not needed and you can skip 2b.

### 1c. Deploy

Per `deploy-auto-calibration-service.md` **Step 3 (Path B)**:

```bash
cd "${VSS_APPS_DIR}"
COMPOSE_PROFILES=auto-calib docker compose \
  --env-file industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/.env \
  up -d
```

### 1d. Verify

Per `deploy-auto-calibration-service.md` **Step 4**:

```bash
curl -sf "http://localhost:${VSS_AUTO_CALIBRATION_PORT:-8010}/v1/ready"
# Expected: {"code":0,"message":"VSS Auto Calibration Microservice is ready"}
```

This brings up `vss-auto-calibration` + `vss-auto-calibration-ui` without perception, BEV Fusion, mosquitto, nvstreamer-mv3dt, or VST. The `auto-calib` compose profile shares only `redis` with MV3DT — teardown later won't collide with anything MV3DT will deploy.

## Step 2 — Drive AMC end-to-end

**Do not reinvent the API flow here.** Walk the AMC skill's mode-specific reference for the input portion, then the shared tail in its `SKILL.md` for verify → calibrate → poll → results. The AMC skill owns the canonical API contract.

| Q1 mode | AMC reference to walk |
|---|---|
| `videos` | [`../../vss-generate-video-calibration/references/videos.md`](../../vss-generate-video-calibration/references/videos.md) (input handling) → [`../../vss-generate-video-calibration/SKILL.md#shared-calibration-tail`](../../vss-generate-video-calibration/SKILL.md) (verify / calibrate / poll) |
| `rtsp` | [`../../vss-generate-video-calibration/references/rtsp.md`](../../vss-generate-video-calibration/references/rtsp.md) (VIOS-mediated ingest) → same shared tail |

Inputs the AMC flow needs from the parent SKILL.md's Q3:

- `project_name` — short slug
- `detector_type` — `resnet` or `transformer`, passed at the AMC shared-tail Step B (`POST /v1/calibrate/<id>`)
- `VIDEO_DIR` (videos mode) or RTSP URLs (rtsp mode)

Capture the `project_id` from the AMC flow's project-creation step — you'll need it in Step 3 to fetch the MV3DT export. Wait until `project_state == COMPLETED` before proceeding.

### 2a. UI-fallback gate — do not skip

After uploading videos (and layout, if local), **pause and direct the user to the AMC UI** ([`../../vss-generate-video-calibration/SKILL.md#ui-fallback-pattern`](../../vss-generate-video-calibration/SKILL.md)) before calling `/verify_project`:

- **Step 3 — Parameters**: tune or review settings (the user may need to adjust parameters for their scene), then **Save**. Also confirm the detector you'll pass to `/calibrate` — Step 3 does not cover it.
- **Step 4 — Alignment**: upload `alignment_data.json` or mark correspondence points on `layout.png`, then **Save**.

Wait for the user to confirm, then verify on disk before continuing:

```bash
MANUAL_DIR="${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects/project_${project_id}/manual_adjustment"
test -f "${MANUAL_DIR}/alignment_data.json" && test -f "${MANUAL_DIR}/layout.png" \
  || { echo "ERROR: alignment missing — user did not Save in UI Step 4"; exit 1; }
```

**Do not treat `verify_project` returning `READY` as sufficient** — some microservice versions return READY without alignment, but calibration will produce unusable poses. The on-disk check above is the gate. If you write a custom driver script, replicate the UI-fallback block from the AMC reference's bundled Python script verbatim.

## Step 3 — Run VGGT refinement, then fetch the MV3DT export

The AMC microservice exposes a dedicated MV3DT export endpoint (documented in [`../../vss-generate-video-calibration/SKILL.md:176-196`](../../vss-generate-video-calibration/SKILL.md)), with two `result_type` variants: `amc` (base) and `vggt` (refined). MV3DT chaining should prefer `vggt` when available.

### 3a. Run VGGT (if staged in Step 1a)

After Step 2's `project_state == COMPLETED`, check `vggt_state` in `/v1/get_project_info/<id>`. If `READY` (model staged + base calibration done), fire VGGT and poll:

```bash
curl -sf -X POST "http://localhost:8010/v1/vggt/calibrate/${project_id}"

while true; do
  vggt_state=$(curl -s "http://localhost:8010/v1/get_project_info/${project_id}" \
    | jq -r '.project_info.vggt_state')
  case "${vggt_state}" in
    COMPLETED) echo "VGGT done"; break ;;
    ERROR)     echo "VGGT failed — falling back to AMC result"; break ;;
    *)         sleep 10 ;;
  esac
done
```

If VGGT wasn't staged (user opted out in Step 1a) or hit `ERROR`, skip 3a and use `result_type=amc` in 3b.

### 3b. Pick the best available result type

```bash
# Prefer VGGT when available; fall back to AMC
if [ "${vggt_state}" = "COMPLETED" ]; then
  RESULT_TYPE=vggt
else
  RESULT_TYPE=amc
fi
```

### 3c. Fetch the MV3DT export (camInfo + transforms.yml)

```bash
curl -sfL "http://localhost:8010/v1/result/${project_id}/mv3dt_result?result_type=${RESULT_TYPE}" \
  -o /tmp/mv3dt_output.zip

# Inspect — ZIP contains transforms.yml and per-cam camInfo files
unzip -l /tmp/mv3dt_output.zip
```

### 3d. Trigger + fetch `calibration.json` (BEV grid + sensor world coords)

The MV3DT ZIP gives you per-camera intrinsics/extrinsics (`camInfo/`), which is what perception needs. `vss-behavior-analytics-mv3dt` needs a different file — the Metropolis-format `calibration.json` with `scaleFactor`, sensor world coordinates, and any ROIs/tripwires defined in the AMC UI. AMC's `export_calibration` endpoints produce this directly:

```bash
# Generate (server writes the export to disk inside the project)
curl -sf -X POST \
  "http://localhost:8010/v1/result/${project_id}/export_calibration?result_type=${RESULT_TYPE}&calibration_type=cartesian"

# Verify the export was written
curl -sf "http://localhost:8010/v1/result/${project_id}/export_exists" | jq -r '.export_file // empty'

# Download to /tmp; Step 4 places it under ${CAL_DIR}
curl -sfL \
  "http://localhost:8010/v1/result/${project_id}/export_calibration?result_type=${RESULT_TYPE}&calibration_type=cartesian" \
  -o /tmp/calibration.json
```

`calibration_type=cartesian` produces the full schema (BA results — same shape as the shipped sample). Use `calibration_type=image` only as a fallback for projects that didn't complete the full BA pass — it produces a pixel-ROI-only file behavior-analytics can still load.

If the user defined ROIs / tripwires via the AMC UI Parameters dialog, they're included in the exported `calibration.json`. If the user ran the API-only path, those arrays are empty — behavior-analytics still starts, just with no analytics rules.

## Step 4 — Land everything at the MV3DT mount path

```bash
DATASET="${SAMPLE_VIDEO_DATASET:?slug from Q3}"
CAL_DIR="${VSS_APPS_DIR}/industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-mv3dt-app/calibration/sample-data/${DATASET}"

mkdir -p "${CAL_DIR}/camInfo" "${CAL_DIR}/images"

# camInfo/*.yaml — perception mounts this directory at /tmp/camInfo/
unzip -j -o /tmp/mv3dt_output.zip 'camInfo/*' -d "${CAL_DIR}/camInfo/" 2>/dev/null \
  || unzip -j -o /tmp/mv3dt_output.zip '*.yaml' -d "${CAL_DIR}/camInfo/"

# calibration.json — fetched in Step 3d
cp /tmp/calibration.json "${CAL_DIR}/calibration.json"

# Optional: reference images for the dataset layout (skip if unavailable)
PROJECT_OUTPUT="${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects/project_${project_id}/output"
ls "${PROJECT_OUTPUT}"/*.png 2>/dev/null | head -4 | xargs -I{} cp {} "${CAL_DIR}/images/" || true

# Permissions — perception mount must be readable inside the container
sudo chmod -R a+rX "${CAL_DIR}"
```

> **Permission rule:** always `chmod`, never `chown`. Containers run as varied UIDs; world-readable is the safe baseline. This matches the convention in `vss-deploy-profile/references/data-directory.md`.

**Sanity check** before moving on:

```bash
ls "${CAL_DIR}/camInfo/"*.{yml,yaml} 2>/dev/null | wc -l   # must equal user's camera count
test -f "${CAL_DIR}/calibration.json" && jq -e '.sensors | length' "${CAL_DIR}/calibration.json" >/dev/null && echo OK
```

Both must pass. If `camInfo/` is empty, the ZIP layout was unexpected — open `/tmp/mv3dt_output.zip` and confirm where the YAML files live. If `calibration.json` is missing or has no `sensors[]` entries, re-check the Step 3d export status via `/v1/result/${project_id}/export_exists` and pull the calibration log: `curl http://localhost:8010/v1/amc/calibrate/${project_id}/log`.

## Step 5 — Tear down AMC

Leave the host clean before MV3DT comes up — they share `redis` and the host:port for `vss-auto-calibration` (still on `bp_wh_*_mv3dt` profile gating, so it will redeploy correctly under MV3DT later).

```bash
cd "${VSS_APPS_DIR}"
COMPOSE_PROFILES=auto-calib docker compose \
  --env-file industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/.env \
  down
```

Project state under `${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects/project_<id>/` is bind-mounted, so it survives the down. You can re-run AMC later without losing work.

## Step 6 — Return to SKILL.md

Calibration is now on disk at `${CAL_DIR}`. Hand back to the parent flow:

1. Walk [`configure-cameras.md`](configure-cameras.md) — set `NUM_STREAMS` to the `camInfo/*.yaml` count, sync DeepStream batch sizes.
2. Walk [`deploy-rtvi-cv-3d-stack.md`](deploy-rtvi-cv-3d-stack.md) — `docker compose up` with `MODE=mv3dt` + `BP_PROFILE=bp_wh_kafka` + `MINIMAL_PROFILE="true"`.
3. Walk [`verify-and-view.md`](verify-and-view.md) — confirm perception FPS, BEV ready, VST video wall.

## Failure modes specific to this chain

Generic AMC failures (verify_project not READY, ERROR early, RUNNING > 90 min, etc.) are covered in [`../../vss-generate-video-calibration/SKILL.md#cross-cutting-troubleshooting`](../../vss-generate-video-calibration/SKILL.md) and the per-mode references — defer to those.

Issues specific to the MV3DT chain:

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| MV3DT export ZIP missing `camInfo/*.yaml` after `result_type=amc` | AMC project didn't produce the MV3DT export — verify `project_state == COMPLETED` via `/v1/get_project_info/<id>` before fetching. |
| `result_type=vggt` returns 404 / empty ZIP | VGGT didn't run to completion. Check `vggt_state` — if `INIT` the model wasn't staged (Step 1a); if `ERROR` see VGGT log. Fall back to `result_type=amc`. |
| `POST /export_calibration` returns non-200 | Project hasn't completed the BA pass — re-check `project_state == COMPLETED`. As a fallback, retry with `calibration_type=image` for a pixel-ROI-only export. |
| `GET /export_exists` returns `export_file: null` after a successful POST | The export run failed silently — pull `GET /v1/amc/calibrate/${project_id}/log` for the failure reason. |
| Downloaded `calibration.json` has empty `sensors[]` | Project completed without sensors registered — verify the upload step (`/upload_video_files` succeeded and `/verify_project` returned READY). |
| Downloaded `calibration.json` has empty `roi` / `tripwire` arrays | Expected — these are user-defined via the AMC UI Parameters dialog. behavior-analytics still starts; just no analytics rules until you define some. |
| User has only 1 camera | MV3DT requires multi-view (≥2 cameras). Use the 2D / 3D-per-camera paths in `vss-deploy-profile/references/warehouse.md` instead. |
| User has 1–3 cameras (< sample count) | Set `NUM_STREAMS` in [`configure-cameras.md`](configure-cameras.md) Step 3 to the actual count; confirm any camera-clustering config (`create_camera_clusters.py`) matches. |
